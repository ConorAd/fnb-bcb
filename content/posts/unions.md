Food not Bombs Belfast has been supporting strikes and picket lines from we started out in August 2022. 

If you are interested in joining a trade union, we recommend finding out if there is a union already in your workplace. If so, why not consider joining the same union as your colleagues and organising together.

Members of Food not Bombs Belfast are active in independent trade unions like [the Industrial Workers of the World](https://onebigunion.ie) and [the Independent Workers Union](https://www.union.ie/) that organise all workers in all sectors.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has a handy [Join a unioin](https://ictu.ie/join-union) page that can help you find a union for your workplace.

Additionally, many members of Food not Bombs are active in the tenants union [CATU](https://catuireland.org) that organises private tenants, social tenants, and mortgage holders to face the housing crisis head on.
