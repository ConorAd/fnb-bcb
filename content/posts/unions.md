## Food not Bombs and Unions

Food not Bombs Belfast has been supporting strikes and picket lines from we started out in August 2022. 

We believe that as members of the working class, we can and will look after ourselves. Strikes are an important tool at our disposal. We want to show our solidarity and support by bringing free hot food and drinks to picket lines and sites of industrial action. 

We do this as solidarity not charity. Both individual strikers and their unions have donated their time, money, and heaps of food to us after meeting over a cup of tea or a vegan breakfast bap on a picket line. When it's us out on strike, we look forward to seeing those we've visited calling by.

## I want to join a union.

If you are interested in joining a trade union, we recommend finding out if there is a union already in your workplace. If so, why not consider joining the same union as your colleagues and organising together.

Members of Food not Bombs Belfast are active in independent trade unions like [the Industrial Workers of the World](https://onebigunion.ie) and [the Independent Workers Union](https://www.union.ie/) that organise all workers in all sectors.

The Irish Congress of Trade Unions has a handy [Join a unioin](https://ictu.ie/join-union) page that can help you find a union for your workplace or for a specific line of work.

Additionally, many members of Food not Bombs are active in the tenants union [CATU](https://catuireland.org) that organises private tenants, social tenants, and mortgage holders to face the housing crisis head on.
